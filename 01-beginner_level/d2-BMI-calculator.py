    One Topic of "Day 2" Lesson
    100 Days of Code - Udemy Lecture by Dr. Angela Yu
'''



"""
Although I'm no beginner, some points taught in the beginner lessons might be useful and refreshing.
Below this point is my personal takeaway note during this lesson (if any):

Note 1:
    Programmers [is better to] always start with 0 to avoid confusion,
    because we also work with binary data which starts from 0.
    (true enough! Surely challenging at the beginning for MATLAB or R user like me)
Note 2:
    It turns out python can use underscore in between the thousands as if it's a comma/point separator,
    so human be able to visualize it easily (for God's sake, I just know this thing after all these years!)
Note 3:
    Function is something like a fancy machine in a factory to take potato into chips.
    So if you give the same machine a rock, it won't work and give you an error instead.
    (love this analogical explanation!)
