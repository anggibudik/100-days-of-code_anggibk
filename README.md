# 100 Days Coding Challenge: a Personal Project #
 This is a repository to store my learning records on ***100 days coding challenge*** personal project (although I might finished it less than 100 days!). The challenge starts from *13th of November 2020* and based on [an online course](https://100daysofpython.dev/ "100 days of python") titled [***100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021***](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/ "100 days of python 2021") taught by <a href="https://github.com/angelabauer">Dr. Angela Yu</a> on Udemy. So technically, this project will finish on *21th of February 2021* at most.
 
 I'm no beginner in the programming world (let alone Python, data science, and stuffs), but I decided to "inversely" challenge myself: follow her unique course from the very beginning as a <i>false beginner</i> to follow up any fundamental things that I might missed all this time.

The course also uses a collaborative online-based IDE repl.it, and my repls can be found <a href="https://repl.it/@anggibudik">here</a> (p.s: this repo is not linked to repls for a certain reason).

The course's content [can be found here](https://github.com/appbrewery/100-days-of-python).

This repository will be updated on daily basis based on the progress, following the course style.
It will also be followed up by other upcoming repositories of the course-related projects later. The list will be made here soon.
